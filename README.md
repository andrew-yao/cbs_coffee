-- Make sure to modify "dbcon.js" to your userinfo.
-- You'll also need to import cbs_db.sql into phpMyAdmin to get tables to show correctly.

As of now, CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE functionality is still a work in progress and still needs to be done.
I'm still experimenting to see how I can get DELETE to work first, followed by CREATE then UPDATE last.
This seems like it may be the easier route to figure things out, but please feel free to alter that.

General SELECT functionality (as shown on each page) has been implemented.
